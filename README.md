## Technologies used:
1. C ([documentation](https://devdocs.io/c/))

## To run this project:
You have one way to run this project:
1. Using Terminal:
    * Download the folder "src"
    * Compile the program (using the makefile)
      ```shellscript
      [your-disk]:[name-path]> make
      ```
    * Finally just run it<br>
      ```shellscript 
      [your-disk]:[name-path]> ./prog
      ```

## To do:
- Implement SIGUSR1
- Clean code
- Find where are the bugs
- Fix the bugs

## Notes important to read:
- This project MUST BE run in Linux (as I said above we will use UNIX specification)
- The files that are on folder "resources" must be on the same folder of *.c files
- For more information about how to use these projects consult the respective Statements (to learn more about commands, signals available and structure of "Config.txt")
